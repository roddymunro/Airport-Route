# Airport-Route
C# application that uses Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the fastest route from 1 airport to another.

I created this application as a way of learning about Dijkstra's algorithm, which had been touched upon during my Computer Science degree, but hadn't been done as part of a practical class. So, I tasked myself with creating an application in my spare time that would utilise the algorithm.

This application comes fully loaded with all the world's major airports and routes.
